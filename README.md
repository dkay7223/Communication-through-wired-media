# Wired Media 

## I. Introduction

This assignment focuses on working with wired media in computer networks, specifically exploring twisted-pair cables. The report outlines the properties of twisted-pair cables and the creation of straight-through and crossover cables for connecting computers/laptops in a network.

## II. Twisted Pair Cable Overview

### Definition
A twisted pair cable consists of two insulated wires twisted together, enhancing electromagnetic compatibility. The twisting reduces electromagnetic radiation, crosstalk, and improves rejection of external interference.

### Categories
Twisted pair cables are categorized into Cat5e, Cat6, Cat7, and Cat8 based on electrical characteristics. They can be shielded (STP) or unshielded (UTP) for additional noise immunity.

### Straight Through Cable
A straight-through cable connects a computer to a network hub or router. Pins on both ends match, providing a direct connection.

### Crossover Cable
A crossover cable connects similar devices, having a different pin configuration on each end. It is used for direct device-to-device connections.

## III. Tasks and Implementation

### Task 1: Cable Creation

- **1 Straight Through Cable:** Created to connect a computer to a network hub.
- **1 Crossover Cable:** Designed for direct computer-to-computer connections.

### Task 2: Connectivity Verification

- Connected two computers/laptops using the created cables.
- Verified connectivity using the ping command.

### Task 3: Shared Folder Access

- Shared a folder on one PC.
- Accessed the shared folder on the second PC over the connected wired network.

## IV. Deliverables

### Detailed Report

- Provided a comprehensive report detailing the completion of each task.
- Included explanations, steps, and screenshots for clarity.

### Screenshots

- Presented screenshots for visual representation of cable creation, connectivity verification, and shared folder access.

## V. Conclusion

The assignment successfully demonstrated the creation of twisted-pair cables, connectivity verification, and shared folder access. The report and accompanying screenshots provide a clear overview of the tasks completed.

**Note:** The detailed report with screenshots will be submitted through the specified platform.
